<p>MyUniTracker is an easy to use tool, designed to give university students and overview of their units semester by semester. It gives them a general overview of how they are going in all their units, as well as giving useful statistics on their GPA (grade point average) and WAM (weighted average mark). It also has a breakdown of each individual unit, by allowing students to add assessments as they get the marks back, and to receive useful statistics such as their current percentage and grade. At the end of semester it will show students what percent they need in the final exam to achieve a selected grade.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<p>The application facilitates the common requirements a university student wants to be able to see but at the press of the button, instead of tediously figuring out these measures. The key features of the application include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Adding, editing and removing current units.</li>
    <li>Adding, editing and removing assessments completed (or even future assessments, by predicting your mark and editing that assessment later).</li>
    <li>Viewing your progress in a specific unit via a graph of assessment results.</li>
    <li>Gives a combined overview of all your results and presents it in just one graph, and also shows your WAM and GPA (see next point).</li>
    <li>Adding past results so the app can calculate your current GPA and WAM (following how UWA does it), and predicts the future values for this based on your results for your units, <strong>at that point in time</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
